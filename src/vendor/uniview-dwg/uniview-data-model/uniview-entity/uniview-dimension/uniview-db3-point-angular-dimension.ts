/**
 * Represents a three-point angular dimension entity in AutoCAD.
 *
 * This dimension type measures the angle between two lines or edges by defining three points:
 * a center point and two points that define the lines or edges being measured. The dimension
 * displays the angle value and typically includes extension lines, dimension lines, and arrows.
 *
 * Three-point angular dimensions are commonly used to measure angles between non-parallel lines,
 * angles of arcs, or any angular measurement that requires three reference points.
